    Found a little bita light, tryna find my heart
   Funny when I'm bright gotta lifestyle dark
   Hundy when I write get a tight flow spark
   With a physco chart, playing dice go start
   Oh who are you better know yourself
   Know your soul gotta know your wealth
   Slow your role getta ahold don't melt
   And don't you fall when it feel like hell
   Oh who am I M.I.M.E I'm not the one you wanna fuck with
   Late nights messin' up my sleep so I'm flustered
   Taking out aggression wit my pen because I trust it
   Writing tryna get myself a lam colour custard

   For the game
   Leave 'em hanging by his chain
   Click bang feel enraged
   Feel it firin' my brain feel insane
   Enda story feel the flame

   45 to the brain praying lord please help No Glory
   No glory I M.I.M.E I'm not the one you wanna fuck with
   Late nights messin' up my sleep so I'm flustered
   Taking out aggression wit my pen because I trust it
   Writing tryna get myself a lam colour custard
   Remember I used to be that kid that everyday would get
   Rejected Yall got my story the glory was painted on a song
   I'm mortified but feel immortal

   This pen to this paper always open up different portals
   Its me and I im by myself im down to ride
   Taking on the tides size of tsunamis touchin' the sky
   I get a quick skan it's time to move
   Leavin' everything else behind I got something to prove

   I'm just running away
   No I ain't running away
   I got memories saved oh Im just finding my place
   Where I belong to
   Barely glory in my soul
   Eyy Im riding away yeah Im finding my place yeah
   I gotta escape yeah. Its what I gotta do
   See you on the other side

   We all know
   No I ain't running running running yeah
   Im coming coming coming yeah
   Knocking all these demons that been tryna run up on me yeah
   Oh I keep on fighting they keep coming coming coming yeah
   Ima keep keep on fighting till Im gone
   I NEED THE GLORY
